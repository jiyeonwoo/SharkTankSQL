# SharkTankSQL
A quick SQL (MySQL) analysis for the US version of Shark Tank.
Data is from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suvroo/shark-tank-us-dataset-1274-48

I explored 8 key business questions:
1. What is the average investment amount of each of the six Sharks, ordered from greatest to least? Similarly, which Shark invested the highest amount? 
2. What is the proportion of successful pitches made in each City / State? Which city or state has the highest proportion of successful pitches?
3. Does the entrepreneur’s gender have an impact on the success of the pitch? 
4. How diverse is each Shark’s investment portfolio? 
5. What industries are the most popular, and which industries produce the pitches with the highest deal amounts? 
6. Is there a trend in original ask amounts and total deal amounts over time? 
7. What is the average equity percentage requested by entrepreneurs and how does it compare to the final equity percentage if the pitch is successful? 
8. Does equity percentage have an impact on the likelihood of a pitch being successful? (Split up equity percentages into deciles, then analyze) 

The SQL queries can be found under "sharktankqueries.sql". The visualizations of the results can be seen in "FinalVisualizations.pdf", and "DM Slides.pdf" contains the visualizations and some written analysis.

This project was done for BAX 421: Data Management.
